RHUH-GBM MRI Preprocessing Repository ðŸ§ 

This repository contains the code for preprocessing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of glioblastomas as described in the following paper:

    The RÃ­o Hortega University Hospital Glioblastoma Dataset: A Comprehensive Collection of Preoperative, Early Postoperative, and Recurrence MRI Scans (RHUH-GBM)
    Santiago Cepeda, Sergio GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, Ignacio Arrese, Francisco Herrero, Trinidad Escudero, TomÃ¡s Zamora, Rosario Sarabia. (2023)
    Preprint available at arXiv.

The code is designed for use on Ubuntu systems and assumes that certain dependencies are already installed and added to the system path.
ðŸ“‚ Expected Folder Structure

The expected folder structure should be as follows:

lua

Main_folder
|-- Subject_001
|   |-- 0
|   |   |-- adc
|   |   |-- t1
|   |   |-- t1ce
|   |   |-- t2
|   |   `-- flair
|   |-- 1
|   |   |-- adc
|   |   |-- t1
|   |   |-- t1ce
|   |   |-- t2

|       |-- t1ce
|       |-- t2
|       `-- flair
|-- Subject_002
|-- Subject_003
`-- ...

In the structure above, subfolder 0 represents the preoperative scan, 1 represents the early postoperative scan, and 2 represents the follow-up scan. The presence of all three time-points is not mandatory.

Subfolders adc, t1, t1ce, t2, and flair should contain the DICOM files.
ðŸš€ Pipeline Overview

The preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

    DICOM to NiFTI conversion using dcm2niix
    Register t1ce.nii.gz to SRI atlas image using FLIRT
    Coregister t1.nii, t2.nii.gz, flair.nii.gz, and adc.nii.gz to the transformed t1ce.nii.gz using FLIRT
    Perform skull stripping on the coregistered volumes using MRI Synthstrip from Freesurfer
    Normalize the intensity of the volumes by z-score using CaPTK
